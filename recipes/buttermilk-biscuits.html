        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add cold butter slices and cut into the flour with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour cold buttermilk into the well and stir gently until just combined.</li>
            <li>Turn dough onto a floured work surface and pat it together into a rectangle.</li>
            <li>Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle. Repeat twice more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.</li>
            <li>Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut biscuits. Reroll any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.</li>
            <li>Transfer biscuits to the prepared baking sheet. Press an indent into the top of each biscuit with your thumb. Brush buttermilk over the tops.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are flaky and golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
